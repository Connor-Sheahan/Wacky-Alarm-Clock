# Wacky-Alarm-Clock
Basically, I kept forgetting to take my medications, so I thought it would be a fun project to code my own alarm clock and make it really wacky.

The code currently only works on my PC due to path and image names and such, but it is pretty simple to change it to work on your own PC if you wish to do so.

This program should be in a folder (mine was named mouse_clickk as seen in the code) with an mp3 file and numerous images. When the time comes (specified in the code), the program will play the mp3 file and switch the desktop background repeatedly between the images in the folder. To stop this chaos, all you need to do is right click and the  program will stop running.

Note: This program works every day so long as it is manually set to run on startup (put a shortcut of the file in "AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup")
